# CATH-summer-2019
This repository contains materials related to superfamily naming and renaming.

This will be an extension of the CATH-summer-2018 repo (https://github.com/CATH-summer-2018), refining the guidelines for naming superfamilies and writing descriptions. There will be a collection of issues that need to be discussed or solved - these may include 3D view not working, conflicting information between Pfam and InterPro, superfamilies that are difficult to name, general chopping issues etc (these can be found in the 'Issues' tab). The 'Wiki' tab will have a list of general guidelines for superfamily naming (do's and don't's) - feel free to contribute with any improvements or ideas!
